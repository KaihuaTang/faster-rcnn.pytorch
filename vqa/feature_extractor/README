Used for extract different visual feature

1. bottom_up_origin.py: get the same visual feature as bottom-up released.
2. bottom_up_stage4.py: feature the the stage4, before roipooling


vqa_data:
    bottom_up_objs: pkl file include detected objs by bottom_up faster rcnn paper;

    features:
        bottom_up_origin: feature same as bottom_up paper
        bottom_up_stage4: feature from output of stage4 in resnet (res4b22)





extract_resnet.py: direct extract grid image feature after faster-rcnn head
extract_box_resnet.py: mapping bounding box to grid image feature maps(which is after faster-rcnn head)
    -> generate coco_448_obj


# remove to bottom-up-attention
extract_mid_resnet.py: mapping bounding box to feature ap which is before faster-rcnn head
    -> generate coco_mid_grid_obj
